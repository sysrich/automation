# Velum bootstrap

This project hosts the former [end-to-end tests](https://github.com/kubic-project/e2e-tests) for the Caasp platform. They are meant to be run against a CaaSP Cluster

This can be either a production environment installed from images, or a [caasp-devenv](https://github.com/kubic-project/caasp-devenv)

Unit and feature tests can also be found in the [velum project](https://github.com/kubic-project/velum).

## Tools

This project is using [Rspec](http://rspec.info/) and [Capybara](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/capybara)
(with Phantomjs driver) to interact with Velum.

## Running the tests

First you need to have a running CaaSP cluster with `velum` ready to register the first user, and at least 2 minions up and running.

To make sure the tests know where to run against you need to specify a `environment.json` file path. This file is usually generated by a [terraform](https://github.com/kubic-project/terraform) setup.

### 1. local cluster generated via [caasp-devenv](https://github.com/kubic-project/caasp-devenv) and [terraform](https://github.com/kubic-project/terraform)

**NOTE**: for this setup make sure to remove provide `DEVENV=true` as all `docker` commands will run on localhost without any ssh access. You can just use the `environment.json` file generated by the [terraform](https://github.com/kubic-project/terraform) setup

```
VERBOSE=true ENVIRONMENT=/home/$USER/caasp/terraform/environment.json bundle exec rspec spec/**/*
```

### 2. production cluster installed via official images

**NOTE**: to be able to run commands in the application containers make sure your public ssh key is in the authorized_keys on the minions
**NOTE**: for this setup make sure to specify `dashboardHost` and `sshKey` as all `docker` commands will run on minions through ssh tunnels. You can just use the `environment.json` file generated by the [terraform](https://github.com/kubic-project/terraform) setup

```
VERBOSE=true ENVIRONMENT=/home/$USER/caasp/terraform/environment.json bundle exec rspec spec/**/*
```
