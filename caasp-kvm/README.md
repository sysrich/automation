# CaaSP KVM

This directory contains the caasp-kvm tool, aimed at replacing the existing caasp-devenv
and terraform repositories.

A primary goal of caasp-kvm is to reduce the number of places where our development
enviroments differ from a customer enviroment, allowing us to more easily ensure our
changes really will work in the final product.

## Requirements

In order to run `caasp-kvm`, a system must have `kvm` installed, `libvirtd` and
`docker` daemons running, and a few additional dependencies must be met. As
root, run:

    zypper in git python-requests qemu-kvm docker virsh libvirt-daemon-qemu
    systemctl enable libvirtd
    systemctl start libvirtd
    systemctl enable docker
    systemctl start docker

Many of the required resources are hosted inside SUSE's private R&D network; in
order to access and connect to these resouces, you may need a SUSE R&D openvpn
connection; see the
[Micro Focus internal wiki](https://wiki.microfocus.net/index.php?title=SUSE-Development/OPS/Services/OpenVPN)
for details.

You must also have SUSE's CA certificates installed, as documented on
http://ca.suse.de . As root:

    # (replace openSUSE_Leap_42.3 with your distro)
    zypper ar --refresh http://download.suse.de/ibs/SUSE:/CA/openSUSE_Leap_42.3/SUSE:CA.repo
    zypper in ca-certificates-suse p11-kit-nss-trust

The user running `caasp-kvm` must be a member of a few additional groups:

    # replace <username> with your username
    usermod -aG docker,libvirtd <username>


The [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) and the
[terraform-provider-libvirt](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt)
providers must be installed.

We maintain packages for both of them inside of the
[Virtualization:containers](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Virtualization:containers)
project on OBS.

You can add this repo and install these packages with just

    $ # (replace openSUSE_Leap_42.2 with your distro)
    $ sudo zypper ar obs://Virtualization:containers/openSUSE_Leap_42.2 Virtualization:containers
    $ sudo zypper in terraform terraform-provider-libvirt jq

Clone these repositories:

    $ git clone git@github.com:kubic-project/velum.git
    $ git clone git@github.com:kubic-project/caasp-container-manifests.git

## Using a cluster from the hypervisor node

The nodes booted will be given fixed/deterministic IP addresses, it it recommended
you create a ~/.ssh/config with the following content, adjusting the SSH key path
as necessary:

    Host 10.17.*
        User root
        IdentityFile /home/kiall/SUSE/caasp/automation/misc-files/id_shared
        UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
        StrictHostKeyChecking no

Each node will have an determinisic IP address, and additional nodes will have the
final octet incremented by 1:

* Admin node will have 10.17.1.0
* First master node will have 10.17.2.0
* First worker node will have 10.17.3.0

## Using a cluster from a non-hypervisor node

It's possible to interact with the whole cluster even from machines that are
**not** the hypervisor node running all the VMs.

This can be useful when your development machine is not powerful enough to
run an entire cluster. In this case we can have all the VMs running on a
powerful workstation and access them from your laptop.

First of all you have to pick a different subnet for the caasp network. This
is done by creating a `terraform.tfvars` with the following line:

```hcl
caasp_net_network = "172.30.0.0/22"
```

You have to be really careful with the subnet you are going to use. The default
one is conflicting with the SUSE R&D network. If your remote machine is
connected to the corporate VPN all the requests made against your cluster will
be swallowed by the VPN.
At the same time you cannot pick networks like `172.16.0.0/13` or
`172.17.0.0/24` because the first one is being used by flannel, while the second
one is used by docker.
A working subnet is `172.30.0.0/22`.

Finally you have to add a route to the cluster on the development machine. The
easiest way is to use the following command:

```
ip -4 route add 172.30.0.0/22 via 192.168.1.39
```

Where `192.168.1.39` is the IP address of the hypervisor node.

You can achieve the same result by setting the rule on your router, pushing
the rule through a local dnsmasq instance,...

### Remote devenv setup

This example shows how to have a remote devenv setup. The goals of this setup
are:

  * Run the cluster on an hypervisor nodes.
  * Develop the code on a laptop.
  * Access the cluster from any local computer.

All the source code is checked out on the laptop inside of
`~/code/kubic`. This is where all the changes are done.

The whole `~/code/kubic` directory is automatically sent to the workstation
(hostname `workstation`) and kept in sync using
[lsyncd](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd) (which has official openSUSE
packages BTW).

The configuration file for `lsyncd` is saved inside of
`~/code/kubic/lsyncd.conf`:

```lua
settings {
  logfile    = "/tmp/lsyncd.log",
  statusFile = "/tmp/lsyncd.status",
  nodaemon   = true,
}

sync {
  default.rsyncssh,
  source    = "/home/developer/code/kubic",
  host      = "developer@workstation",
  targetdir = "/home/developer/code/kubic",
  exclude   = {
    "automation/downloads/**",
    "*.tfstate",
    "*.tfstate.backup",
    "*.terraform" }
}
```

Now it's just a matter of going to `~/code/kubic` and leave this command running:

```
lsyncd lsyncd.conf
```

Now you can go to the workstation and use caasp-kvm as usual.
