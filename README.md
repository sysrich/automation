# Development

Where possible, use Python, Ruby, Bash.

Tools should be able to run on developer workstations and in CI runs.
Prefer configurable paths.

CI logs can be difficult to inspect: avoid output that look like
errors if unnecessary. Structure the output with headers and footers if needed.

Common CLI options:
```sh
 -h                help
 -l --logfile      write logs to a file (used to capture logs in CI)
 --outdir          output directory (used to capture artifacts in CI)
 --env-json-path   environment.json file path
```
